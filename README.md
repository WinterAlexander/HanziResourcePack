# HanziResourcePack

**Downloads**: https://github.com/WinterAlexander/HanziResourcePack/releases

This repo is a generator for minecraft resource packs. It adds 汉字 (hanzi) on top of an existing minecraft resource pack's 
block textures so that the entire game shows 汉字 characters on every block. The "Hard" version of this pack strips away 
textures so the player must read the chinese in order to play the game. Use the pinyin version of the release to see the 
pinyin on top of the 汉字 onto textures.

Note that the chinese translation are found using the game's files and the pinyin is generated using [hanzi-tools](https://github.com/peterolson/hanzi-tools).
